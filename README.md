# Pathfinding-Algorithms
Pathfinding algorithms implementation and visualization. This file uses two implementations of pathfinding algorithms; which are:

- A*/A-star algorithm
- Dijkstra algorithm

The implementation of A* itself is kind of different from other implementations. But my implementation is still correct according to the Wikipedia page (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Weighted_A_star_with_eps_5.gif#/media/File:Weighted_A_star_with_eps_5.gif)

# The Controls:
- Place current location -> mouse click
- Place target location -> Tab
- Place walls -> hold 'W' and move the mouse around
- Delete walls -> hold 'Q' and move the mouse around
- Clear/Restart -> 'C'

- Run A* algorithm -> 1
- Run Dijkstra algorithm -> 2
